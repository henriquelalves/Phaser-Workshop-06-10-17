# Basic-Phaser-Boilerplate
Basic Phaser boilerplate without dependencies.

## How to install
Just git-clone/download this project in the folder you want and you are ready to go!

## How to use
You'll need a HTTPServer to test the project (all Phaser projects need one).

If you are using Linux/macOS:

1. Open your terminal.
2. `cd where_your_project_folder_is`.
3. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`.
4. The project will start running in the browser on `localhost:8000`.

If you are using Windows, ~~good luck!~~ there are software to simulate HTTPServers;
you'll have to look for them, though. Try [stackoverflow!](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5050851/best-lightweight-web-server-only-static-content-for-windows).

When you change the code, just refresh the browser page. Sometimes the browser will use
the cached version of the page, so you'll have to refresh a couple of times more.
