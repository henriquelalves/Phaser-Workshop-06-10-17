    // purpose is to load the assets you want to use.

    // you want to appear on the state. It only happens once!

    // to 60fps in the browser as it can.

    // ========== PRIVATE METHODS ===========
    // Remember to be careful not to name any private method
    // of the class as one of the reserved methods, or things
    // will go awry.
